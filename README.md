## Seunghyun Lee 👋 <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=sseung0703" alt="sseung0703" />
- Welcome to my Github page. I am a Ph.D. course student at Inha Univ. in South Korea. My research areas are machine learning, deep learning, and especially the light-weighting the convolutional neural networks such as knowledge distillation and filter pruning.

## ML libraries 🧱
  - Tensorflow (1.x and 2.x): Professional
  - Pytorch: Upper intermediate
  - JAX: beginner
