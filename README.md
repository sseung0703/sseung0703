## Seunghyun Lee 👋 <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=sseung0703" alt="sseung0703" /> 
- Welcome to my Github page. I am a Ph.D. candidate (expected March 2023) at Inha University in South Korea. <br>
  My research areas are machine learning, deep learning, and especially the light-weighting the convolutional neural networks such as knowledge distillation and filter pruning. <br>
  You can find my curriculum vitae [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSyW0NjszxZd_hQAdyuykIQJwOx9GFWXsbXTLCx76AqyPSOBktd-Sg3QeH12wNoTzoxhuygTipTtvam/pub).

## ML libraries 🧱
  - Tensorflow (1.x and 2.x): Professional
  - Pytorch: Upper intermediate
  - JAX: intermediate
